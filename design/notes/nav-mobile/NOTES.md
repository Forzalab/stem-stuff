# NAV MOBILE (D75) — NOTES.md

Pipeline: brain directive 13 (`_files/NOTES-PIPELINE.md`). One stage or ONE loop round per session. Append only.

## 0. Goals (Tony)
- One nav pattern for the quiz page that works on phone AND desktop.
- She always sees ONE clear next step (Check, then Next). Nothing important below the fold.
- Phone and desktop feel like the same app (same buttons, words, places).
- Bench goal (raised after R1): **best variant median ≥ 85 AND unity ≥ 15/20 from every tester.**
- Cap: R2 + 2 more rounds (R3, R4). Then report to Tony, whatever the score.

## 0.1 Converted from handoff (`_drift/2026-10-07T1005-main-handoff-genui-swarm-stop.md`, brain)
- Code: branch `ccr-81108955-ufvhze-navmock` @42c3c19 (no PR yet). Page `try/nav-mobile.html?v=1..7`.
- Design doc: `design/plans/NAV-MOBILE.md` on that branch. §7 = round 2 changes, checks, SHAME CHECK.
- R1 medians: v4 85 · v3 83.5 · v5 81.5 · v2 79.5 · v7 78.5 · v1 74.5 · v6 74. Reports: brain `_files/blind-judge/nav-r1/`.
- R2 slots renumbered: v1 = v4 phone + v3 desktop hybrid. v6 = v4 + v5 hybrid (result panel above the thumb button).
- Designer favourite v4 (One thumb button, same bar on desktop). Runner-up v6.
- R2 testers were killed before scoring in the old session → R2 reruns from scratch here.
- Method: brain `topics/blind-judge-method.md` "Variant 2". Brief: brain `_files/blind-judge/NAV-TESTER-BRIEF.md`.
  Score 0-100 = clarity 30 + clutter 25 + frustration 25 + unity 20. Fresh testers every round.
- Harness: worktree of `-navmock`, `python3 -m http.server 8880`, brain `_files/blind-judge/drive.mjs`: phone 8921–8924, desktop 8931–8934.
- Pass → open PR for `-navmock` (Tony merges). Fail → designer revises from TOP FIXES, next session runs the next round.
